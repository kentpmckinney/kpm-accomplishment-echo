Summary: `A call flow process tool that saved Dell millions`
Description: `
Company: Stream Global Services

Year: 2008

Purpose: a call flow tool named ‘Echo’ was used by 400+ technical support reps. It included several time-saving features favored by technicians as well as aspects desired by management to collect data not available through other means and improve adherence to call requirements. It included several types of automation, such as the validation of street addresses, looking up data in various internal, web-based line-of-business applications, and data-entry into CRM tools.

My Role: I was the technical lead for the project which had six team members over a period of a year and a half. I wrote about 50% of the code over the life of the project. I once counted having written more than 30,000 unique lines of JavaScript/JScript code for 10+ different projects at this company, more than 10,000 lines of which are included in Echo.

Outcome: over a three-month trial period of Echo, the average handle time of calls decreased enough to save the client $3 million dollars of billable call time. The scores of most contractual metrics improved over the same time period, so the reduced costs did not come at the expense of quality. Exactly how much of these improvements were attributable to Echo is unknown, though it was considered by management to have played a large role. All of the improvements at that time helped convince the client that our center could handle additional lines of business. Echo was in use for about two years in its original form.

Technical Details: Echo is an HTA (HTML Application), an older technology intended to make web pages look and feel like Windows desktop applications. Echo included 36 different .js files in its final version. Due to budget constraints, this unusual tool was designed to run from a shared drive without needing a server, and so the functionality of the application was almost entirely JavaScript/JScript.
